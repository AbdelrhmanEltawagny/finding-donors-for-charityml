# finding-donors-for-charityml
In this project, we do some data analyzes and build some prediction models. We also analyze the performance of these models and choose the best model for an unreal organization called charityml

# What is the idea of the project ?

In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. our goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.

# Steps
1.explorind data and do some transformations and data processing

2.We choose three of the models and test their performance on our data

3.We recommend the best model

4.We improve this model by tuning the hyperparameters
